# Reducing annotation burden in MR: A novel MR-contrast guided contrastive learning approach for image segmentation


The availability of limited labeled data for supervised medical image segmentation tasks motivates the use of representational learning techniques for deep learning (DL) models. The current work presents a novel MR contrast guided self-supervised contrastive learning approach to reduce the annotation burden in MR segmentation tasks. The proposed contrastive learning strategy shows a) the feasibility to learn tissue specific information that controls MR image contrast using information from a large set of unlabeled multi-contrast data, and b) its application to improve performance on subsequent segmentation tasks on single contrast data. The results, across multiple datasets and segmentation tasks, demonstrate that learning to embed underlying tissue-specific information can leverage the limited availability of labeled data and, in turn, reduce the associated annotation burden on clinicians.
